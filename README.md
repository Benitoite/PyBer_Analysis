The purpose of this analytical task is to create a visualization of weekly fare totals by city type.  The three types of city under consideration in this analysis are Rural, Suburban, and Urban.  One of the datasets made available to the analyst includes the type of city- we will use this data to construct a dataframe that is resampled per-week and graphed per city type on the same axes.

Information such as the number of drivers per city type was generated by codes such as the following:
```
# 2. Get the total drivers for each city type
# Get the TOTAL number of drivers for each urban city.
urban_driver_count = city_data_df.groupby('type').sum().loc['Urban']
# Get the TOTAL number of drivers for each city for the suburban and rural cities.
rural_driver_count = city_data_df.groupby('type').sum().loc['Rural']
suburban_driver_count = city_data_df.groupby('type').sum().loc['Suburban']
[urban_driver_count, suburban_driver_count, rural_driver_count]
```
Which generates the following output:
`[driver_count    2405
 Name: Urban, dtype: int64,
 driver_count    490
 Name: Suburban, dtype: int64,
 driver_count    78
 Name: Rural, dtype: int64]`

This type of data is useful in creating visualizations such as the pie chart, because each element represents a part of a whole. For example, with the code `plt.pie(chartTheseData, labels=['Urban', 'Suburban', 'Rural'], shadow= True, startangle=90, explode=[.1,.1,.2], autopct='%1.1f%%')`, python will generate this type of pie chart:
